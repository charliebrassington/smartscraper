Depth of knowledge in large-scale product ecosystem design, embedded application design and physical product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After working in the product design industry for the past 20 years, I recently left my comfortable design job to strike it out on my own and follow my passion. As an avid outdoorsman, I have long enjoyed treks into the backcountry, overland journeys and soaking up everything nature has to throw at me. Along the journey I realized that making products for outdoor adventures brought together my product design experience, my lifelong love of the outdoors and a passion to build community. I recently started a design collective to bring amazing products to market and have the opportunity to work with friends, both new and old, along the way. &lt;a href=\"http://www.overlandhammock.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Overland Hammock&lt;/a&gt;is the first product we are launching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to starting Overland, I worked as Senior Director, Design for Global Design Studios at TEAGUE. I led a talented group of designers, hackers, programmers, prototypers and technologists committed to building a new and better world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before to joining TEAGUE, I worked at Microsoft where as Principal Creative Director, I defined the next generation search experience for Office 365, and led the design of one of the most advanced gaming consoles in the world, Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honing my skills and broadening my experience, I spent almost a decade at global design consultancy frog, where I managed cross-functional design teams in the development of compelling user interfaces across multiple platforms to creative cohesive, intuitive, and immersive user experiences. With more than 20 years experience delivering high quality design solutions, I have had the great fortune of working with some of the worldâ€™s leading brands including Samsung, Boeing, B/E Aerospace, Amazon, Intel, Logitech, Nike, Facebook, Panasonic, AT&amp;amp;T, Microsoft, Motorola, HP, Qualcomm, Vodafone, ESPN.com, the American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experienced creative with a deep love of all things design, I am passionate about creating compelling products and services that are platforms for exploration and experimentation, as well as being positioned for marketplace success.&lt;/p&gt;",
